# VVordle â€“ Code Overview

VVordle is a small, readable Vue 3 + Vite implementation of Wordle. This document focuses on how the code is structured and how the game logic works.

This repository is open sourced for learning purposes only â€” the original creator(s) of Wordle own all applicable rights to the game itself.

## Project layout

- `src/main.ts` â€” App bootstrap; mounts the app and manages a `--vh` CSS variable for mobile viewport sizing.
- `src/Game.vue` â€” The core game: board state, input handling, guess evaluation, messages, and animations.
- `src/Keyboard.vue` â€” On-screen keyboard component. Emits key events consumed by `Game.vue`.
- `src/words.ts` â€” Word lists and `getWordOfTheDay()` selection logic (with querystring override for demos/tests).
- `src/types.ts` â€” Shared types and the `LetterState` enum.
- `src/game.css` â€” Styles for the board, tiles, and animations.
- `test/Keyboard.test.ts` â€” Unit tests for keyboard behavior.
- `test/words.test.ts` â€” Unit tests for word-of-the-day logic.

## Data model

- Tile: `{ letter: string, state: LetterState }`
- Board: `Tile[][]` â€” 6 rows Ã— 5 columns
- `LetterState` (see `src/types.ts`): `INITIAL`, `PRESENT`, `CORRECT`, `ABSENT`
- Keyboard letter states: `Record<string, LetterState>` used to tint keys as information is discovered

## Component contracts

Keyboard (`src/Keyboard.vue`):
- Props
	- `letterStates: Record<string, LetterState>` â€” latest knowledge about each letter
- Emits
	- `key` with a payload of `'a'..'z' | 'Enter' | 'Backspace'`

Game (`src/Game.vue`):
- Listens for `window` keyup and `<Keyboard @key=...>` to funnel all input through a single handler.
- Controls progression via `allowInput` so animations can complete before accepting more input.

## Game flow and evaluation algorithm

1) Input collection
- On letter: fills the next empty tile in the current row.
- On Backspace: clears the last non-empty tile in the current row.
- On Enter: validates and evaluates the guess if the row is full.

2) Validation
- The guess must be in `allWords` unless it equals the actual `answer` (answer is always allowed).
- Invalid: show message "Not in word list" and briefly shake the current row.

3) Scoring (three passes)
- Pass 1: Mark exact matches as `CORRECT` and null out those positions in a working copy of the answer.
- Pass 2: Mark remaining letters as `PRESENT` if they exist in the working copy (consuming one occurrence).
- Pass 3: Mark anything else as `ABSENT`.
- Keyboard coloring is updated monotonically (e.g., `PRESENT` wonâ€™t be downgraded to `ABSENT`).

4) End states
- All five tiles `CORRECT`: show a success message, generate a sharable result grid (ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬œ), and set `success=true`.
- Not solved and rows remain: advance to the next row after flip animations.
- Out of rows: reveal the answer.

5) UX details
- Tile flip, shake, and jump animations are driven by CSS, using transition/animation delays for a cascade effect.
- `main.ts` sets `--vh` on resize to work around mobile viewport sizing issues.

## Word-of-the-day selection

`getWordOfTheDay()` (`src/words.ts`):
- Base behavior: deterministic daily selection based on a start date (e.g., `new Date(2022, 0, 0)`).
- Override for demos/tests: if `location.search` contains a raw base64 word (e.g., `?Y2lnYXI=` for `cigar`), that is used instead.
- Exposes `allWords` for validation.

## Tests

Powered by Vitest (jsdom) and Vue Test Utils:
- `Keyboard.test.ts`: mounts the component and asserts it emits `key` for a letter, Enter, and Backspace (SVG button).
- `words.test.ts`: uses fake timers to pin the date and verifies both the base case and the base64 override path.

Run tests:

```sh
yarn test        # watch mode
yarn test:run    # one-shot
```

## Run locally

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Build

```sh
yarn build
```

This produces a static build suitable for hosting. The current Vite setup emits to `docs/`.
